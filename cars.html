        <h2>Pato O'Ward</h2>
        <p class="phrase">With us all the way.</p>
        <p>
          Our day 1, Pato took our flagship car and has led us to 4 wins. He led
          the most laps in last year's Indianapolis 500, and he's bound to show
          the world what success looks like.

        <h2>David Malukas</h2>
        <p class="phrase">The new kid in town.</p>
        <p>
          He may be new, but he's not new around the paddock. One of the fan
          favorites, David brings a cool, calm, and collected fun to his team,
          the fans, and in his driving style.

        <h2>Alexander Rossi</h2>
        <p class="phrase">500 Winner. Creed Listener.</p>
        <p>
          He looks like he's mad, but he's a great guy. Rossi won the 100th
          Running of the Indianapolis 500, and has shown success in all types of
          tracks, especially road courses.
